The plan is to have a bunch of students that want to sign up for classes.

They have ranks of preferences for certain classes. They get these preferences randomly. They have a preference for all the classes, but in order from greatest to least.

The trick is, there is just enough space for all students in all the classes, but the students won't all get into the classes they want.

The goal is to get the most students to get the most classes that they want.
